# regolith

My configuration of the Regolith tiling Windows Manager.

## i3 user

I used i3 for a while.I like Regolith better, but I don't like the bindings. I have restored many of my old key bindings from
i3 to regolith. In some ways the regolith key bindings make a lot of sense. Objectively the default regolith keybindings are
probably better than mine. But my fingers know mine.

## Why not both?

One of the great debates among i3 users is whether to use the Alt key or the Windows key. After playing around I decided to use both.

I3 comes with the alt key configured by default. I left the default configuration and added a couple of more. I use the alt key for "system" operations.

I use the Windows key to launch applications. On one level it makes sense to use the Windows key to launch windows. But the big advantage is I have the full keyboard available to launch applications without worrying about stepping on any of the default system keys.

### Why not all three?

I do like some Regolith keybindings like mod-Backspace to toggle direction. So I have incorporated some of the regolith commands into my configuration. However, most of the regolith adaptations are system operations. I changed them from using the Windows key to using the Alt key.
